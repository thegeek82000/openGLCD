vi:ts=4

1.0 release fixes:

- fix the html/doxygen documenation for the GLCD control/glcd_device functions.
For some reason in the newest doxygen, you don't automatically get the hyperlinks anymore.

- update/remove googlcode references in the additional resources section.
Specifically MCUIO and GLCDv3

- add a way to read current row and col using GetAreaProp()
This will not work correctly with proportional fonts.

- update ks0108 html wiring section to include how to wire up backlight
transistor

- think about changing FORCE_CORECODE mode.
It might be useful to force core code mode but still use
the board specific pin config file.
currently it also forces the use of the "corecode" pin config file.
Maybe there needs to be 2 seperate defines?

- update documentation for CoreCode mode.
This includes the wiring table and config file documenation.
Perhaps intruduce the term "board specific" configuration vs "generic" or "corecode".
This is affect by the force corecode decision above


==============================================================================

- 1.6.5 IDE supports local HTML consider using it for local documenation
Unfortunately the path is chrooted so you can't get to directories above
where the sketch lives


- modify build script to work even if not using a git tree
	Should be able to just check for .git file and then make up
	version stuff if it doesn't exist.

- Create a "known issues" "file" that can be read into doxygen as well
	- Streaming support is no longer included in the library.
		users that wish to use stream must install Mikal Hart's Streaming library:
			http://arduiniana.org/libraries/streaming
			
	- Some cores only work on 1.x+
		- mighty1284p 
			Because they don't include support for pre 1.x IDE
		- Leonardo
	- pre 0019 IDE is no longer supported
		to simplify the openglcd API and make it consistent across pre/post 1.x,
		no support for pre 0019
		- before 0019 the analog pin constants didn't exist
		- before 0019 the String class didn't exist.
	- 0019,0020,0021, 0022, 0023 pre 1.x IDEs won't work with newer avr-libC
		Header file nightmares! 
		 (new <util/delay.h> uses math.h )
			- comment out #include <avr/delay.h> in wiring_private.h
				(none of the core code uses/needs it)
			OR if wanting to make util/delay functions available:
			- must add #include <math.h> to top of wiring.h
				wiring.h #defines the math functions and breaks math.h
				math.h must be included before defines stomp on math functions

	- chipKIT MPIDE issues
		- with recent drop of plib support, openGLCD now no longer supports
			MPIDE versions prior to 0023 2013-07-15
		- has #error in <avr/pgmspace.h> down in compiler tools
			hardware/pic32/compiler/pic32-tools/pic32mx/include/avr/pgmspace.h
			all the pgmspace types/defines should be in pgmspacd.h not wiring.h
			wiring.h should then include <avr/pgmspace.h>  if necessary
			Best option would be to create a avr directory under the core library
			and put a pgmspace.h there with all the AVR mappings and 
			leave the one with the #error down in the compiler tools alone.
			The new pgmspace.h will override the one down in the compiler tools
			and that will offer AVR compatiblity for Arduno environment.
		- missing
			- PGM_P
				#define PGM_P const char *
			- PSTR()
				#define PSTR(s) ((const char *)(s))

	- GLCD_Bigdemo does not fit on Leonardo
		(GLCDv3 version fits, openGLCD version does not)

	- potential duplicate declarations of fonts & bitmaps
		Currently if a font header or bitmap header is used in seperate
		seperate compilation units, there will be duplicate data.
		In Arduino all modules are combined by the IDE into a single .cpp so
		that while the seperate "modules" may include a font or bitmap header
		again, the gaurd ifdefs will prevent its actual inclusion.
		If the IDE is not being used there is the potential that multiple
		data declarations happens.
		The long term strategy to address this is to have a .cpp file that
		includes the allFonts and allBitmaps files for the data declarations.
		the allbitmaps.h and allFonts.h files will use an ifdef to determine
		whether to include the fonts or to just declare extern references to
		the objects.
		There will be no impact to any user code.
		It will impact the JAVA tool that creates the allBitmaps.h header file.

- support sketch pin configuration.
	possible:
		glcdio_xxx() becomes either a function or a macro.
		The current glcd__xxx() macro mappings need to reference _glcdio_xxx()
		that way the glcd_xxx() functions can use the _glcdio_xxx() macros.
		So the top level glcdio_xxx() "functions" are either a macro that call _glcdio_xxx()
		or a function that also calls _glcdio_xxx().

- consider adding a "libinfo" sketch
	This can print out all the openGLCD libary information
	like diags does but not require any GLCD hardware.
	It could also print out the exact config file in use
	as well as the exact location of the html documentation
	or even a file://xxxxx line that can be cut & pasted into
	the browser.
	OR maybe just added to diags?

- create glcd types to replace PSTR and PGM_P
	 so that mainline code does not depend on proprietary types.

- Rendering issues for fixed witdh fonts smaller than 7/8 bits tall (in bitbucket)
	- inverse is messed up.
	- examine newbasic3x5 & Wendy3x5

- fix hd44102 autoconfig file to use its own pin config rather than ks0108

- build change (consider)
	Consider having "readme" in VCS be a readme for openGLCD
	Have the build script create
		- openGLCD/doc all of it
		- openGLCD/readme.txt (which overwrites the VCS readme).

		The build script would copy files from a "release" area that includes
			doc/*
				html stuff
			ReadMe.txt at root
			ReleaseNotes.txt at root
		It would be a directory tree for each type of release
		"Arduino" being the only one right now.
			

- New Demos
	-iFPS (iFPS demo - NEW)
	-cp437 font example (done)
	-openGLCDGraphics (done)
		called "GraphicAPI"
	-openGLCDText

- update doxgen for backlight functions to indicate that
  backlight must be configured in config files.

- update doxygen for how to install???
This makes more sense when documenation is hosted on line
since you can read the documenation without having to install the s/w.

- Update diags text output in doxygen (to show new version info)

- need to add GLCD.top & GLCD.Left to coordinate system photo
	Pretty much need to update/replace all photos in doxygen

- need to add example of wiring up using real datasheet.
	- need to mention active low vs active high chip select signals

- Remove FontCallback routine

- look at pin order of config files
	- Teensy vs others
	- consistency of CSEL3 & CSEL4
	- Should pin order match pin configuration table order in doxygen? 

- add API examples:
    - Text
		low
			Printf_P
			EraseTextLine
			DrawSring_P
			printFlash ??
			printFlashln ??
			printNumber ??
			Puts_P
			Streaming i/o (done)

	- Graphics
		low
			-DrawBitmapXBM_P
    - Device
		low priority
			- GotoXY
			- ReadData
			- WriteData

- Nano & Micro have their own variants
	- have seperate pinconfig files?
	- nano is m328 variant same as "standard" but defines 8 analog pins
	- micro is 32u4 variant same as "leonardo" except LED definitions.

- change checks for pin/feature support.
	- instead of checking for pin definition,
	  change glcdio to define/not-define "function" macro based on
	  pin defintion, then have mainline code check for existence
	  of "function" macro vs checking for pin definition.

- move LCD_OFF checks & code to glcdio and new glcdio  "function" macro

- Verify ARM delay code
 (seems to be fairly accurate, 450ns delay is about 480 or so)

- Make colors BLACK and WHITE types/enums
	Be careful on this as enums are bigger/slower than uint8_t
	Also consider adding "PIXEL_ON" and "PIXEL_OFF" to simplify color usage. (DONE)
	Also consider adding a color for "transparent" for DrawBitmapXBM()
	Also consider adding a color "XOR" which allows drawing, across filled regions. (FUTURE...)
		This is easy. It only requires updating SetDot() SetPixels().
	Also consider adding a color "TRANSPARENT" or "PIXEL_CLEAR" which allows leaving pixel alone. (useful for bitmaps)

- update code to use C99 "fast" types: ??
	uint_fast8_t
	int_fast8_t

- Add a "width" field to PrintNumber? or obsolete the function completely?

- remove/eliminate FontRead access function ReadPgmData()
	It is in glcd.cpp but used by gText.cpp
	This is also used by things that need pgm data like bitmap functions.
	use a glcdio macro instead?

- Change inheritance  (has implications for doxygen stuff)
	glcd: gText glcd_device
	gText: Print
	glcd_device: (none)

- track down why DrawString() uses 242 bytes of RAM and HelloWorld only uses 94
	(some of this was debugging in gText.cpp)

- track down why HelloWorld is larger with openGLCD
	- UNO
		- 0022  650 bytes larger 
		- 1.0 6682 vs  6014 (668 bytes)
		- 1.0.5 6660 vs  5992 (668 bytes)
	- Teensy2++
		- 1.0 7788 vs 7128 (660 bytes)

	- Related to emptysketch that includes <openGLCD>
		~5k of code
			Seems to go away if PutChar() in write() is commented out.
			For some reason Print class write() is being drug in.

- eliminate tAS delays on writes? Seems to work on Teensy3
(didn't make much performance difference, 9.97 to 10.02 FPS)

GLCD issues to solve:
47 - move SetDisplayMode() from glcd to glcd_device
53 - e-gizmo gizduino support

	affects APIexamples

- move glcd.h to include directory
- rename include/delay.h include/glcd_delay.h

- rename glcd_Config.h to openGLCD_Config.h
- rename glcd_Buildinfo.h to openGLCD_Buildinfo.h
- Rename doc/GLCDref.htm doc/openGLCDref.htm
	Will need to check for references in code and documenation/readme etc...
- Rename build/doc/doxygen/GLCDref.htm build/doc/doxygen/openGLCDref.htm
- Rename GetTextProp() to GetAreaProp()  (DONE)
	- What about SetTextMode() and ClearTextMode() ?? (DONE)
		Change to SetAreaMode() and ClearAreaMode() ?? (DONE)
		Backward compatibility???
		Make SetTexMode() deprecated? (DONE)

- update auto config panel files to use auto config pinconfig header
	- currently they are doing their own pin config file includes
- Remove fonts/font12x16.h font (it is not in correct format for library)
- check all config files for backlight control defines
	- panel files for backlight control define
	- pin config file for backlight pin define
- fix pin order in MEGA config file to match others
- fix pin order in Sanguino config file to match others
- add DrawBarGraph() to glcd API ???
	DrawVBarGraph(x,y, width, height, border, minval, fullval, currval)
	DrawHBarGraph(x,y, width, height, border, minval, fullval, currval)
	negative width means width is to left of x
	negative height means height is above y

	if width negative on DrawHBarGraph graph starts on right and advances to left
	if width positive on DrawHBarGraph graph starts on left and advances to right
	if height negative on DrawVBarGraph graph starts a bottom and advances up
	if height positive on DrawVBarGraph graph starts at top and advances down

- clean up ARM delay code 
- create a GLCD v3 compatibility header file (done)
	This will remap/adjust the function parameters of
	DrawHLine, DrawVLine, DrawRect, DrawRoundRect
	in the sketch.
	That way you can translate them to account for the +1
	pixels when the width/height size changes.
	Example
	#define DrawHLine(x, y, width, ...) DrawHLine(x,y, width+1, ##__VA_ARGS)
	handles optional color with gcc varargs for macros.
	This way the actual openGLCD code is not modified and the
	compatibility is done just for the sketch.
	i.e. something like
	#include <openGLCD_GLCDv3.h>
	This header should make GLCDv3 sketches "just work",
	It will also need dummy values for the GLCD version numbers.
	It won't work for GLCDdiags since it uses lots of internal stuff.
- Update photos for diags in doxygen (done)
- review deprecated stuff (done)
  It was all removed since there is no
  deprecated stuff yet. This is a new library.
  There is a openGLCD_GLCDv3.h compatibilty file.

- add doxygen examples for DrawVBarGraph/DrawHBarGraph in glcd.cpp
- insert ascii schematic for backlight circuit into examples that use backlight control

- check remove/replace all references to ks0108 playground page
	- definitely in doxygen stuff
- Remove all references to "ks0108 library"
	Shows up in doxygen.
		"previously.... ks0108 library"... etc..
- compare/sync include/avrio.h to the "official" avrio.h in mcuio

- update/cleanup build/debug part of tree
- FillRoundRect API function
- updates to build script for 
#define GLCD_GLCDLIB_REVSTR "DevRev"  // development rev string

- FillCircle() and DrawCircle() are different boundaries. (FIXED)
 Fill circle is one pixel bigger on the bottom half.
 ellipse dimensions are 2 * xRad by 2 * yRad (center pixel shared vs extra)
- trace down progmem / const/ static stuff (DONE)
	warnings vs errors on AVR vs ARM.
	using "static" creates warning:
		'xxx" defined but not used if the var isn't used
		If you add "const" to it, the warning goes away.

	Creating a dummy reference to the static data will
	eliminate the warning. If the dummy reference is not referenced
	the dummy reference and static data is also removed by the linker.
	i.e create a dummy function that assigns te font/bitmap to a dummy
	variable.

	on ARM if you don't use "const" then the data is put into RAM.
	in c++ you have to use "extern" on declaration initialization as well to make a global.
	if not it is the same as static and will be deleted if the local file does not reference it.
	Trick is if you want to use the same declaration on C and C++ if you want a local in C
	you must use 'static' which will then create a local (including with const) for C and C++

	you cannot mix const and non const variables in same section or you get a linker error
	i.e. if some PROGMEM vars are const and some aren't then it won't link.
	the dreaded: "varname causes a section type conflict"
	On ARM if PROGMEM is defined to be nothing, then no error but if const was not
	used then vars end up in RAM.


	Recommendation:
	- put all openGLCD fonts and bitmaps in their own .progmem section with
	  FONTDECL and BITMAPDECL

	- define PROGMEM to use .rodata for ARM so that sloppy AVR users can
	  get their data into flash instead of RAM.

- update font doxygen page to reflect location of
  of openGLCDFontCreator tool.
	- Update links to FontCreator2 in doxygen ("Additional Resources")
		 [ it points to google code glcd-arduino]
	Will need to point to place in new repository

- Clean up references to SCROLL_UP/SCROLL_DOWN
- cleanup/remove old font rendering code in gText.cpp
- cleanup bmp2glcd  (done)
	- move over under bitmaps/utility? (done)
- rename config files (done)
	"Arduino" becomes "Uno" (done)
	panel: [module]-{glcdChip}_AutoConfig_Panel.h
	autopinconfig: [module]-{glcdChip}_AutoConfig_Pins.h
	pinconfig: [module]-{glcdChip}_PinConfig_{BoardType}.h
	manualconfig: [module]-{glcdchip}_ManualConfig.h
	[module] name is optional

- update comment in header of pinconfig files (done)
  to reflect boards it works with.

- add digitalFastxx routines to chipKIT core (done)

- Move extra fonts in "Fonts" subdirectory somewhere else until
  verified & converted to openGLCD (done)

- Arduino core code fall back mode so it works on any "Arduino" board. (Done)
- chase down gcc macro expansion issue when using MPIDE (Done)
	for some reason the pic32 compiler is fully expanding macros
	when doing stringification.
	This breaks diags as it can't display pins like A0, A1, etc...
	They get improperly expanded as their pin #s.

	This is due to chipkit using #defines for A0-An instead of
	const int declarations. When using #defines the pre-processor
	recursively replaces the macro to get the final result.

- Arduino core code fall back mode override to force its use? (done)

- update clock demos to extract time from sketch __TIME__/__DATE__ (done)

- remove Streaming.h from include directory (done)

- needs fixes for when user does "import library" of openGLCD (done)
	FIX: moved compat header to include directory
	FIX: provided a compat header named glcd.h.compat that can be renamed glcd.h

	This inserts includes for all libraries in the openGLCD root
	which will cause code to drop back to GLCDv3 mode.
	possible choices:
		- move openGLCD_GLCDv3.h to include directory (done)
			To do this, there could be a define like GLCDCFG_GLCDv3Mode
			that is used by openGLCD.h to include <include/openGLCD_GLCDv3.h>
			Sketches that want GLCDv3 compatibilty would simply turn on
			the defne before including openGLCD.h

			The optional user created glcd.h header would contain:
			#define GLCDCFG_GLCDv3Mode
			#include <openGLCD.h>

			Alternatively, rather than an ifdef the sketch could simply
			include both for compatibility:
			#include <openGLCD.h>
			#include <include/openGLCD_GLCDv3.h>

			Seems cleaner to include both as it keeps the openGLCD.h header "pure".

			Note: that this only works if there is NEVER any code in the actual
			library that changes for GLCDv3 compatibilty, 
			which is probabaly as it should be.

		- play games with gaurd defines since openGLCD.h is included
			before openGLCD_GLCDv3.h

- add library name "openGLCD" to build info from build script so openglcd.h header doesn't hard code it
- add support for Arduino IDE library.properties metadata:
name=WebServer
version=1.0
author=Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@example.com>, Pippo Pluto <pippo@example.com>
maintainer=Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@example.com>
sentence=A library that makes coding a Webserver a breeze.
paragraph=Supports HTTP1.1 and you can do GET and POST.
category=Communication
url=http://example.com/
architectures=avr

- add note to TroubleShooting to check for solder issues on GLCD to header connections

- decide how to handle the writeUTF8() function with doxygen.
	Should it exist for documention even though it is disabled by default?
	Should it exist and map to write() or should it not exist to cause a link error.
	I'm leaning tward a link error when not enabled.
	SOLUTION: It will ALWAYS exist in documentation but will only exist in code if enabled.

- Fix glcd_Device.cpp getStatus() function to ensure pullups are on.
	Handled by doing it AVR code as well as portable code.
	In portable mode, if INPUT_PULLUP is not available, then pullups are not enabled.
	This shouldn't be an issue since it is only used diring selftest and only comes into
	play if the module is wired up incorrectly.

- update diags to show glcd config defines.
	All conig defines are reported
